The library provides a fast and memory-efficient implementation of the algorithm, making it suitable for analyzing large datasets. It is designed to find frequent itemsets in a transactional dataset, where each transaction is a set of items. It calculates the support of each itemset, which represents the frequency of occurrence of that itemset in the dataset. The library then generates association rules based on the frequent itemsets, allowing you to discover relationships between items."
